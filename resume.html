	<p><b>Following the outbreak of Covid 19 virus and like many other people,<br>
			  I too found myself taking advantage of the opportunity for retraining.<br>
			  QA was the right and natural choice for me.<br>
			  Graduate at the <i>"College of Automation"</i><br> as a software tester.<br>
			  Enthusiastic and attracted to the world of testing and its importance, theoretically and practically, including writing test documents STP, STD, STR.<br>
			<br>Although I am at the beginning of my QA journey, but I come with a lot of skills that I've acquired during my life.

	<p><b>
At 2019,while I was still producing,<br>
 and along with my other <span style=color:red;>love</span> for fashio,<br> I started a new brand called<br>
 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Yu-Me-Fashion-for-rhythmic-gymnastic-690885454683726/ " target="_blank">YU ME - Fasion for Rhythmic Gymnastics</a>. <br>
The global training outfit code is mostly black, however , no one said anything about borring or flat... <br>
So I accepted the challange and 5 months later I launched my first summer collection.<br>

I think that beyond the lovely desings and the uncompromising good quality of the clothes,<br>
 what made YU ME so special, was the fact that we produced everythig "blue and white"  <br>
